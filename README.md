The Javascript code focuses on the functionality of the quiz.
Declares variables in the global scope and function will ensure that the quiz starts when start quiz is pressed. 
Includes functions that will set the timer which will count down from one minute. 
Functions will enable the quiz to stop when it reaches the last question and will then display the high scores that were saved in the local memory. 


The HTML code sets up the website to separate the different parts of the website. 
The high scores will print after the questions are completed and the initials inputed are gotten from local memory and placed into list format. 


The CSS helps create the style of the website and designs things like the headers and the start quiz square. 
It also makes the website render the questions in the center of the site.
